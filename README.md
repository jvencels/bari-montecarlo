Reasearch project in Bari, spring 2013
===============

During March-May of 2013 I'm working on a research project in Bari, Italy, creating a Monte-Carlo simulation of electron beams in a collisional medium. This is the code.

The project will be developed in FORTRAN77 using OpenMPI for parallelization.
